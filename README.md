# FiberSEM
Dataset of scanning electron microscopy images of polymeric fibers made by electrospinning. 

Detection and assessment of fibers is a routine task in biological engineering due to the prevalence of fibrous structures in both natural extracellular matrices and artificial scaffolds. When evaluating fibrous scaffolds, accurate determination of parameters such as diameter distribution, porosity, and morphology is essential. However, existing methods task are not reliable enough and suffer from significant limitations, hindering their widespread adoption. To address these challenges, the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) presents an opportunity to develop a more robust and universally applicable solution.

The FiberSEM dataset is formed to help with training of neural networks.

Ð¡urrently it is in the process of being updated.
